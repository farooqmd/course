"$1 bottles of beer on the wall, $1 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, $2 bottles of beer on the wall."

1. Write "99 bottles of beer on the wall" in plain C++
- Basic loop
- output

2. Write a function 
void replace_all(string &s, string target, string replacement)
that replaces all occurrences of target in the string s with the
replacement.
- Write a function, read docs

3. Use the function to rewrite "99 bottles of beer". 
Use the text 
"$1 bottles of beer on the wall, $1 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, $2 bottles of beer on the wall."
and replace $1 by the amount before and $2 by the amount after
drinking.

4. Now write a zeromq program that opens a pull server and bind to
port 4242 on your machine and a push client that connect to port 4242
on the neighboring machine to the right. 
The program will receive a message that consists of a number and a
text. In the text, it shall replace all occurrences of "$1" with the
number and all occurrences of "$2" with (number-1) and output the
text. Then it shall pass on the message with the number reduced by 1.

You will need 
  zmqpp::context
  zmqpp::socket::socket(context, socket_type)
    - socket_type can be zmqpp::socket_type::{pull,push}
  zmqpp::socket::bind(endpoint) 
   
  zmqpp::socket::connect(string)
  zmqpp::socket::send(message)
  zmqpp::socket::receive(&message)
  zmqpp::message
  message << whatever 
    - put whatever into message
  message >> whatever 
    - gets whatever from message
